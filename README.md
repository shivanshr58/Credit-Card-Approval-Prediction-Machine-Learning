# Introduction to Credit Card Approval Prediction Project:

In the financial sector, particularly in the credit card industry, the ability to accurately assess an individual's creditworthiness is paramount. As banks strive to mitigate risk while acquiring new credit card customers, the integration of data science methodologies has become increasingly crucial.

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning approaches to predict credit card approval based on customer information. Traditionally, banks have relied on application scorecards to assess creditworthiness, integrating factors such as Credit Bureau Scores (e.g., FICO Score in the US, CIBIL Score in India), and internal data. However, with the advent of advanced data analytics and the availability of vast amounts of external data, banks can now enhance their credit assessment processes significantly.

In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that utilizes both traditional and non-traditional data sources to assess credit card applicants' risk levels. By analyzing historical data and employing machine learning algorithms, we seek to create a robust credit scoring system that can accurately predict credit card approval decisions.
